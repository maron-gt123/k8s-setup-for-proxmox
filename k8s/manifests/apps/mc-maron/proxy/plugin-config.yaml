    # How the plugin should store data
    #
    # - The various options are explained in more detail on the wiki:
    #   https://luckperms.net/wiki/Storage-types
    #
    # - Possible options:
    #
    #   |  Remote databases - require connection information to be configured below
    #   |=> MySQL
    #   |=> MariaDB (preferred over MySQL)
    #   |=> PostgreSQL
    #   |=> MongoDB
    #
    #   |  Flatfile/local database - don't require any extra configuration
    #   |=> H2 (preferred over SQLite)
    #   |=> SQLite
    #
    #   |  Readable & editable text files - don't require any extra configuration
    #   |=> YAML (.yml files)
    #   |=> JSON (.json files)
    #   |=> HOCON (.conf files)
    #   |=> TOML (.toml files)
    #   |
    #   | By default, user, group and track data is separated into different files. Data can be combined
    #   | and all stored in the same file by switching to a combined storage variant.
    #   | Just add '-combined' to the end of the storage-method, e.g. 'yaml-combined'
    #
    # - A H2 database is the default option.
    # - If you want to edit data manually in "traditional" storage files, we suggest using YAML.
    storage-method: MariaDB
    
    # The following block defines the settings for remote database storage methods.
    #
    # - You don't need to touch any of the settings here if you're using a local storage method!
    # - The connection detail options are shared between all remote storage types.
    data:
    
      # Define the address and port for the database.
      # - The standard DB engine port is used by default
      #   (MySQL: 3306, PostgreSQL: 5432, MongoDB: 27017)
      # - Specify as "host:port" if differs
      address: 192.168.10.131
    
      # The name of the database to store LuckPerms data in.
      # - This must be created already. Don't worry about this setting if you're using MongoDB.
      database: mc_LuckPerms
    
      # Credentials for the database.
      username: minecraft
      password: 'masaya0209'
    
      # These settings apply to the MySQL connection pool.
      # - The default values will be suitable for the majority of users.
      # - Do not change these settings unless you know what you're doing!
      pool-settings:
    
        # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
        # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
        #   connections to the database backend.
        # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
        #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
        maximum-pool-size: 10
    
        # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
        # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
        #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
        #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
        minimum-idle: 10
    
        # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
        # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
        #   connection time limit.
        maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes
    
        # This setting controls how frequently the pool will 'ping' a connection in order to prevent it
        # from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure, measured in milliseconds.
        # - The value should be less than maximum-lifetime and greater than 30000 (30 seconds).
        # - Setting the value to zero will disable the keepalive functionality.
        keepalive-time: 0
    
        # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
        # connection from the pool, before timing out.
        connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds
    
        # This setting allows you to define extra properties for connections.
        #
        # By default, the following options are set to enable utf8 encoding. (you may need to remove
        # these if you are using PostgreSQL)
        #   useUnicode: true
        #   characterEncoding: utf8
        #
        # You can also use this section to disable SSL connections, by uncommenting the 'useSSL' and
        # 'verifyServerCertificate' options below.

      # - Change this if you want to use different tables for different servers.
      table-prefix: 'luckperms_'
    
      # The prefix to use for all LuckPerms MongoDB collections.

      # - This only applies for the MongoDB storage type.
      # - Change this if you want to use different collections for different servers. The default is no
      # prefix.
      mongodb-collection-prefix: ''
    
      # The connection string URI to use to connect to the MongoDB instance.
      #
      # - When configured, this setting will override anything defined in the address, database,
      #   username or password fields above.
      # - If you have a connection string that starts with 'mongodb://' or 'mongodb+srv://', enter it
      #   below.
      # - For more information, please see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/
      mongodb-connection-uri: ''

    # |    Controls the ways in which LuckPerms will sync data & notify other servers of changes.    | #
    # |     These options are documented on greater detail on the wiki under "Instant Updates".      | #
    # |                                                                                              | #
    # +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
    
    # This option controls how frequently LuckPerms will perform a sync task.
    #
    # - A sync task will refresh all data from the storage, and ensure that the most up-to-date data is
    #   being used by the plugin.
    # - This is disabled by default, as most users will not need it. However, if you're using a remote
    #   storage type without a messaging service setup, you may wish to set this to something like 3.
    # - Set to -1 to disable the task completely.
    sync-minutes: -1
    
    # If the file watcher should be enabled.
    #
    # - When using a file-based storage type, LuckPerms can monitor the data files for changes, and
    #   automatically update when changes are detected.
    # - If you don't want this feature to be active, set this option to false.
    watch-files: true
    
    # Define which messaging service should be used by the plugin.
    #
    # - If enabled and configured, LuckPerms will use the messaging service to inform other connected
    #   servers of changes.
    # - Use the command "/lp networksync" to manually push changes.
    # - Data is NOT stored using this service. It is only used as a messaging platform.
    #
    # - If you decide to enable this feature, you should set "sync-minutes" to -1, as there is no need
    #   for LuckPerms to poll the database for changes.
    #
    # - Possible options:
    #   => sql           Uses the SQL database to form a queue system for communication. Will only work
    #                    when 'storage-method' is set to MySQL or MariaDB. This is chosen by default if
    #                    the option is set to 'auto' and SQL storage is in use. Set to 'notsql' to
    #                    disable this.
    #   => pluginmsg     Uses the plugin messaging channels to communicate with the proxy.
    #                    LuckPerms must be installed on your proxy & all connected servers backend
    #                    servers. Won't work if you have more than one Velocity proxy.
    #   => redis         Uses Redis pub-sub to push changes. Your server connection info must be

    #   => nats          Uses Nats pub-sub to push changes. Your server connection info must be
    #                    configured below.
    #   => custom        Uses a messaging service provided using the LuckPerms API.
    #   => auto          Attempts to automatically setup a messaging service using redis or sql.

    push-log-entries: true
    
    # If LuckPerms should broadcast received logging entries to players on this platform.
    #
    # - If you have LuckPerms installed on your backend servers as well as a Velocity proxy, you

    # - When set to true, LuckPerms will cancel login attempts if it is unable to load permissions data
    #   for a user, or if the storage provider is unavailable.
    # - When set to false, LuckPerms will allow a player to connect regardless of whether their
    #   permissions data could be loaded.
    # - This option does not exist on other platforms, and effectively defaults to true - however,
    #   the option is provided on Velocity, as it is less likely to be so dependant on permissions.

    #
    # - Possible options:
    #   => accumulate   durations will be added to the existing expiry time
    #   => replace      durations will be replaced if the new duration is later than the current
    #                   expiration

    # Controls how LuckPerms will determine a users "primary" group.
    #
    # - The meaning and influence of "primary groups" are explained in detail on the wiki.
    # - The preferred approach is to let LuckPerms automatically determine a users primary group
    #   based on the relative weight of their parent groups.
    #
    # - Possible options:
    #   => stored                  use the value stored against the users record in the file/database
    #   => parents-by-weight       just use the users most highly weighted parent
    #   => all-parents-by-weight   same as above, but calculates based upon all parents inherited from

    # - It is explained and documented in more detail on the wiki under "Prefix & Suffix Stacking".
    #
    # - The options are divided into separate sections for prefixes and suffixes.
    # - The 'duplicates' setting refers to how duplicate elements are handled. Can be 'retain-all',
    #   'first-only' or 'last-only'.
