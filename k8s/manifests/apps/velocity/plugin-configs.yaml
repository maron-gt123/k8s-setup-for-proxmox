      # How the plugin should store data
      #
      # - The various options are explained in more detail on the wiki:
      #   https://luckperms.net/wiki/Storage-types
      #
      # - Possible options:
      #
      #   |  Remote databases - require connection information to be configured below
      #   |=> MySQL
      #   |=> MariaDB (preferred over MySQL)
      #   |=> PostgreSQL
      #   |=> MongoDB
      #
      #   |  Flatfile/local database - don't require any extra configuration
      #   |=> H2 (preferred over SQLite)
      #   |=> SQLite
      #
      #   |  Readable & editable text files - don't require any extra configuration
      #   |=> YAML (.yml files)
      #   |=> JSON (.json files)
      #   |=> HOCON (.conf files)
      #   |=> TOML (.toml files)
      #   |
      #   | By default, user, group and track data is separated into different files. Data can be combined
      #   | and all stored in the same file by switching to a combined storage variant.
      #   | Just add '-combined' to the end of the storage-method, e.g. 'yaml-combined'
      #
      # - A H2 database is the default option.
      # - If you want to edit data manually in "traditional" storage files, we suggest using YAML.
      storage-method: MariaDB
      
      # The following block defines the settings for remote database storage methods.
      #
      # - You don't need to touch any of the settings here if you're using a local storage method!
      # - The connection detail options are shared between all remote storage types.
      data:
      
        # Define the address and port for the database.
        # - The standard DB engine port is used by default
        #   (MySQL: 3306, PostgreSQL: 5432, MongoDB: 27017)
        # - Specify as "host:port" if differs
        address: 192.168.10.131
      
        # The name of the database to store LuckPerms data in.
        # - This must be created already. Don't worry about this setting if you're using MongoDB.

        # These settings apply to the MySQL connection pool.

        pool-settings:
      
          # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
          # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
          #   connections to the database backend.
          # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
          #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
          maximum-pool-size: 10
      
          # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
          # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
          #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
          #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
          minimum-idle: 10
      
          # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
          # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
          #   connection time limit.
          maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes
      
          # This setting controls how frequently the pool will 'ping' a connection in order to prevent it
          # from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure, measured in milliseconds.
          # - The value should be less than maximum-lifetime and greater than 30000 (30 seconds).
          # - Setting the value to zero will disable the keepalive functionality.
          keepalive-time: 0
      
          # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
          # connection from the pool, before timing out.
          connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds
      
          # This setting allows you to define extra properties for connections.

      # This option controls how frequently LuckPerms will perform a sync task.
      #
      # - A sync task will refresh all data from the storage, and ensure that the most up-to-date data is
      #   being used by the plugin.
      # - This is disabled by default, as most users will not need it. However, if you're using a remote
      #   storage type without a messaging service setup, you may wish to set this to something like 3.
      # - Set to -1 to disable the task completely.
      sync-minutes: -1
      
      # If the file watcher should be enabled.
      #
      # - When using a file-based storage type, LuckPerms can monitor the data files for changes, and
      #   automatically update when changes are detected.
      # - If you don't want this feature to be active, set this option to false.
      watch-files: true
      
      # Define which messaging service should be used by the plugin.
      #
      # - If enabled and configured, LuckPerms will use the messaging service to inform other connected
      #   servers of changes.
      # - Use the command "/lp networksync" to manually push changes.
      # - Data is NOT stored using this service. It is only used as a messaging platform.
      #
      # - If you decide to enable this feature, you should set "sync-minutes" to -1, as there is no need
      #   for LuckPerms to poll the database for changes.
      #
      # - Possible options:
      #   => sql           Uses the SQL database to form a queue system for communication. Will only work
      #                    when 'storage-method' is set to MySQL or MariaDB. This is chosen by default if
      #                    the option is set to 'auto' and SQL storage is in use. Set to 'notsql' to
      #                    disable this.

      #   => nats          Uses Nats pub-sub to push changes. Your server connection info must be
      #                    configured below.
      #   => custom        Uses a messaging service provided using the LuckPerms API.

      #   permissions data could be loaded.
